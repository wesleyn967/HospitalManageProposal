# Project Proposal

# Patient Portal Management System

# CareNet

# Description
> CareNet is a secure patient portal management system that allows providers and patients to collaborate on managing medical care. Our motivation is for patients to be able to take control of their care and coordinate with their providers. Our goals are to give patients the ability to access all sorts of medical information in one place to provide a higher quality of care. The problem that our app solves is reducing potential cases of miscommunication and confusion that can occur with the short amount of time each provider has with their patients. CareNet gives patients the freedom they desire when handling their medical needs and allows the provider to supply care efficiently. 

> CareNet will be accessible as a secure online portal through any desktop web browser. It provides 24/7 access without having to call the provider. CareNet empowers the provider to handle medical administration easily and patients to make informed decisions on their health needs.

> What sorts of features will the app have?
> * Scheduling appointments 
> * View test results
> * Handling medical records on file
> * Refilling prescriptions
> * View medical bills
